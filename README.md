# Analyzing FIFA 19 player dataset

The original FIFA 19 Dataset  is sourced from Kaggle which includes thorough information about the FIFA19 game. The data was
scraped from https://sofifa.com/. There are +80 features per player, including attributes (eg: shooting, passing, defending skills, value &
wage, release clause and others).

This is a simple analysis I put together as my final project for completing the Python Data Science course 2019 at RMOTR.com. <br>
The analysis is divided into 4 main sections: Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Insights and Machine Learning and Predictions. 

Libraries used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib (Radar chart)
* Seaborn (Clustermap, Heatmap, Correlatio Matrix)
* Sklearn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Features Importance)

Please see [Project Code](https://github.com/jojoms711/FIFA-2019-data-analysis/blob/master/Project%20code.ipynb) in the notebook for analysis details.
